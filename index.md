## Deep Learning Projects

### eKYC Application
e-Know your customer is an AI server-based mobile application that enables users to perform KYC in a digital way by just scanning their National identity card. EKYC consists of many components which facilitates users to verify their identity and validates the genuineness of a scanned National identity card. This application is divided into 4 categories named: Card verification which checks the genuineness of the card, User verification:  Verifies the actual owner of the card by matching facial features of live selfie and image from the scanned card, User Liveness check: checking if the KYC done by the person is an actual person or not, OCR: using tesseract library to extract card details for further procedure. It’s an ongoing project in which we are adding more components and enhancing existing features.

**Technologies Used**
Python, Flask, Tensorflow, Nginx, uWSGI, Machine Learning algorithms, OpenCV, Object detection, face recognition, template matching, Cuda, Visual Studio Code, Jmeter, MySQL, REST API, Tesseract, Keras

### Eye tracking and Blink Detection for Driver's Surveillance
For security measures especially when driving at night, its very important to monitor the driver's state of mind like whether he/she is getting distracted or is feeling drowsy or is having heightened emotions. Hence I've come up with the AI solution that will monitor the mentioned above in real-time and when any of the above activity is triggered, the system will alert the driver to focus.

**Technologies mainly being used**
1. Dlib
2. OpenCV
3. Python

**Planning to extend**:
1. web-based and mobile application
2. train the deep learning model and fuse it with natural language processing

### Gender Prediction of the given name using LSTMs
It’s a self-made project for gender prediction using the LSTM network, for a given name.

**Technologies Used**
Tensorflow, Python, OpenCV, Keras, LSTM

### Gesture Recognition
Providing a Deep learning solution for feature extraction and classification for gesture recognition using Caffe.
6 set of human gestures were taken in consideration which are: Left hand wave, Right hand wave, Clapping, Drumroll, Left hand circular wave, Right hand circular wave. Motion information were captured and extracted using Optical Flow to train the neural network. The model was inspired by IBM's TRueNorth chip.

**Technologies Used**
Caffe, Python, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, Lmdb, Numpy, PIL(Pillow)

## Machine learning Projects

### Credit Card Fraud Detection and Prevention System
Fraud Detection and Prevention System is a security solution that analyzes suspicious user details, behavior, transaction details and reports before it escalates into fraud, identity theft, or other financial crimes. It’s an ongoing project in which we are trying to replace the existing system using AI techniques.

**Technologies Used**
Python, Flask, Machine Learning Algorithms, MySQL, REST API, Keras
